# Scheduled-Fish-Feeder
This is the code that controls and ESP32 to move a 28ybj-48 stepper motor at specific times of the day to move a 3D printed rail that dispenses food for my betta fish.

- Will add BLE support to set the time of day to dispense food later, (right now I just manually program the time)
